#Operation
1. The hex program takes the inputs from the calcNum.txt file, in this case it is supposed to be "calcNum.txt".
2. To run you should use "./hex", it will just use any file named "calcNum.txt"
3. To recompile or compile you use the makefile commands, 'make clean' to remove the file and 'make' to compile.
4. Any file with the same format can be added, it just has to be of the same format
5. For any operator, if you only want/need two inputs you must put a throwaway value for the third input. For example the third input for the MOV is just '0'.
6. To use after running, just press 1. If you press zero it exits. Whatever you do, do not use anything but 1 or 0 (Jumpscare). 
#Creation Process
    The program is pretty simple. Could have been done in way less lines and way more simple, but in an attempt to Future Proofâ„¢ it has been made with a bit of infrastructure.
Simply asks the user what they want to do, reads the file, and operates.
