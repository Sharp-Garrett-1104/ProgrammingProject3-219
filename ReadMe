#Operation
1. The hexCalc program takes the numbers from the CLA file, in this case it is supposed to be "calcNum.txt".
2. To run you should use "./hexCalc calcNum.txt", it will not run properly without a file in the command line. 
3. To recompile or compile you use the makefile commands, 'make clean' to remove the file and 'make' to compile.
4. Any file with the same format can be added, with unlimited amount of hex numbers. 
5. For any operator, if you only want/need one input you must put a throwaway value for the second input. For example the second input for the NOT is just '1'.
#Creation Process
    The program is pretty simple. Could have been done in way less lines and way more simple, but in an attempt to Future Proofâ„¢ it has been made with a bit of infrastructure.
Simply asks the user what they want to do, reads the file, and operates.
